# Password Checker

The website [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com) allows us to check if our password has been hacked. 
It compares our password to a password list, which includes breached passwords. 

Since entering our password in plaintext on a site is not the most secure way, the homepage also provides us with an API to compare the first five characters of our password SHA1 hash.

The graphic below shows how the process works:
